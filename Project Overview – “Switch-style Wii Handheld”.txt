Project Overview – “Switch-style Wii Handheld”
Our project is to take a Nintendo Wii motherboard, cut it down to its smallest functional size, and turn it into a handheld console similar to a Nintendo Switch. The system will have detachable controllers, a built-in screen, a battery for portable play, and a dock that connects to a Linux PC.
How it Works – Big Picture
Trimmed Wii motherboard: We’ll keep only the essential section with the CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage, making it small enough to fit in a handheld shell.
Detachable controllers: Each half of the controller works wirelessly and has its own battery. When attached to the handheld, they charge via USB-C pogo pins. Even when attached, they’ll send input wirelessly, so the physical connection is only for charging.
Controller bridge: Inside the handheld, there will be a small board that takes both halves’ inputs and combines them into one “virtual” GameCube-style controller, so the Wii sees it as a single gamepad.
Screen & display switching: The handheld will have a screen for portable play. When docked, the Wii’s video output will be captured and sent over USB-C to the dock, which displays it on a Linux PC.
Dock: The dock is basically a Linux computer that can:
Show the Wii’s output like a capture card
Transfer files to and from the Wii’s storage over the same USB-C cable
Charge the handheld’s battery while docked
Battery & cooling: The handheld will have its own rechargeable battery for around 3 hours of play. Cooling will be handled by a small fan and heat sink.
